# Numerical PDEs

A Python library for numerically solving PDEs, built from composable pieces: a mesh, a boundary condition, a spatial reconstruction, a time integrator, and an equation.

Two equations are currently implemented (both 1D, finite-volume):

- **Wave equation** (`WaveEquation1D`) — solved with an upwind numerical flux; has a known exact solution for checking accuracy.
- **Burgers' equation** (`BurgersEquation1D`, inviscid) — solved with a Kurganov–Tadmor (central-upwind) numerical flux.

Each can be run at first order (`ConstantReconstruction` + `ForwardEuler`) or second order (`MinmodLinearReconstruction` + `SSPRK3`).

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd time-stepping-neural-network
uv pip install --system -e .
```

## Running the simulation

```bash
python scripts/run_simulation.py
```

This solves the wave equation and Burgers' equation at first and second order, prints L2 errors against the exact solution (wave equation only), and saves plots to `scripts/plots/`.
